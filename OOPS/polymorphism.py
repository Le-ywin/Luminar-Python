POLYMORPHISM

-> Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
-> It enables a single interface to be used with different types of data.
-> Polymorphism is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and can be implemented in Python in several ways.

1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)

-> When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

2. Method Overloading (Not Directly Supported in Python)

-> Python does not support traditional method overloading like Java or C++. However, it can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments.

3. Operator Overloading

-> Python allows operator overloading, meaning operators like +, -, *, etc., can be redefined for custom objects.

4. Duck Typing (Dynamic Polymorphism)

-> Python follows the "duck typing" philosophy: "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."
   This means that objects are used based on their behavior rather than their class.
